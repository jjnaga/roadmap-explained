<!-- Plan:
two computers - google computer and your computer
how they connect (your ISP connects both)
Using an IP vs www.google.com
Transfering the HTML file (for now its just HTML that gets sent)
then go to ch1: what is an HTML file -->
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>Stack so far</h1>
<ul>
    <p>Nothing.</p>
</ul>

<h1>Ch 0.0: The Internet</h1>
<p>A web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) is the application that we use to access the World Wide Web. But for our purposes, modern web browsers are unnecessary. All a web browser is, is an input that we can put websites into. Let's start with step 1, having a file.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this website, imagine the internet just consists of two computers, Google's, and your computer. The picture looks a little something like this:</p>
<img src="images/0-simplified-internet.jpg">

<p>The internet is just a bunch of wires connecting every computer to each other. There is no magic at play, just a very long cord. Now I live in Hawaii, so my laptop is all the way in Hawaii, and the Google Computer is located in California. This means that there is a cable that runs all the way from my laptop to the Google computer in California.</p>

<p>This cable is managed by your Internet Service Provider. So to be technical, your computer connects to your ISP, and the ISP connects to the Google Server. But imagine that in this internet, there exists only two computers. Yours and Google's.</p>
