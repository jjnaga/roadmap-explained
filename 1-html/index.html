<p>Above is the bare minimum of what consitutes an HTML page. You can argue that HTML requires less or more, but for the sake of a greenhorn web developer, this is all you need.</p>

<p>As described in Ch0, HTML is just text. Through tags such as: <xmp><p></p></xmp> the browser knows that this line of text is a pargraph, or a header, or a link. By itself, any html file is nothing more than text. However, when a web browser opens that file, it takes all your tags, and implements what it thinks a tag should look like.</p>
