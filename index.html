<h1>Front-End Roadmap Explained</h1>
<p>This website attempts to dive into the 'why' of each step that is layed out in <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap">developer-roadmap</a>. Each step contains within it a million hours of thought, a million lines of code, a million reasons why it was implemented. The hope is that by understanding the 'why' of why each step/technology gets added to our stack, we can become a more efficient web developer.</p>
